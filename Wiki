Welcome:

Welcome to your wiki! This is the default page we've installed for your convenience. Go ahead and edit it.

Wiki features:

This wiki uses the Markdown syntax. The MarkDownDemo tutorial shows how various elements are rendered. The Bitbucket documentation has more information about using a wiki.

The wiki itself is actually a git repository, which means you can clone it, edit it locally/offline, add images or any other file type, and push it back to us. It will be live immediately.

You can check out the source of this page to see how that's done, and make sure to bookmark the vast library of Pygment lexers, we accept the 'short name' or the 'mimetype' of anything in there.

Have fun!

Why private repository rather than a public one?

Private repository helps in limit the application source code access control to only secured users by this way it helps in application security and ideas cannot be steeled or copied.

Major disadvantage of public repository is, all other external stakeholders can access the code if they know about the repository.

Use of public messenger?

The public platform of communication helps in ease the communication with internal and external stakeholders.
